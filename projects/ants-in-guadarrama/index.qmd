# Altitude Associated Changes in ant Morphology and Genus-dependent Resource Preference in Guadarrama Ants"

Ant Morphology Analysis

Our study took place in the Guadarra Mountains of Spain. Scientist measured the size of the different morphological structures of a multitude of ant taxa across varying altitudes and regions of Guadarra mountain range as well as the resources ants were observed using. We aim to analyze how the size of the measured morphological features varies with altitude as well as to understand a genus-specific preference for certain resource types across ant taxa. 

The data sets we used can be found here:

## HYPOTHESIS 1 

```{r}
# Import Data + Create Dataframes

Ant = read.csv("Ant_traits_in_central_Spain.csv", header = TRUE) #Importing data set into R from local device for Hypothesis 1 

# Result: Data in R environment, ready to be manipulated and tested for statistical significance 
```

```{r}
# Data Summary Calculations

head_mean = mean(Ant$head) #Create data frame for the mean size of ant head
print(head_mean) #Output the value in 'head_mean', the mean size of the head

leg_mean = mean(Ant$leg) #Create data frame for the mean size of ant leg
print(leg_mean) #Output the value in 'leg_mean', the mean size of the leg

scape_mean = mean(Ant$scape) #Create data frame for the mean size of ant scape
print(scape_mean) #Output the value in 'scape_mean', the mean size of the scape

eye_mean = mean(Ant$scape) #Create data frame for the mean size of ant eye
print(eye_mean) #Output the value in 'eye_mean', the mean size of the eye
```


```{r}
# Test for Statistical Significance (Linear Model)

mod_head = lm(head ~ altitude, data = Ant) #Creation of a linear model calculations for head measurements in relation to altitude
summary(mod_head) #Displaying the results of the linear model calculation 
  
mod_leg = lm(leg ~ altitude, data = Ant) #Creation of a linear model calculations for leg measurements in relation to altitude
summary(mod_leg) #Displaying the results of the linear model calculation 

mod_scape = lm(scape~ altitude, data = Ant) #Creation of a linear model calculations for scape measurements in relation to altitude
summary(mod_scape) #Displaying the results of the linear model calculation 

mod_eye = lm(eye~ altitude, data = Ant) #Creation of a linear model calculations for eye measurements in relation to altitude
summary(mod_eye) #Displaying the results of the linear model calculation 

# Result: All morphological features analyzed had a statistically significant relation to altitude (p-value < 0.05)

  geom_smooth(method="lm") + 
  labs(x='Altitude (in meters)', y='Logged Eye Size')

# Result: Four figures depicting the relationship of ant morphology to altitude
