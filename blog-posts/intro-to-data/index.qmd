# Data Science Presentation for Association of Computing Machinery

**Description:** Introductory data science presentation and project walkthrough with Gettysburg College students

::: columns 
::: {.column width="55%"}
The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) in Gettysburg College is a student-led organization where students from different disciplines and fields with interest in computer science gather to learn from each other and to form a community on campus. For this week's meeting, gave a presentation on "Into to Data Science", demonstrating the data science and data analytics workflow, from data exploration, hypothesis testing, and modelling processes useful to answer data-driven questions. This presentation is adapted from Kaggle's [Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster' Machine Learning Competition.](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data){.external target="_blank"}

# Installing Libraries 

import numpy as np # Numopy is a fundamental python library for scientific computation 
import pandas as pd # Pandas provides fast data structures and data analysis tools for manipulating data in python
```



```{python}
# Loading Datasets

# Titanic survival data is divided into two datasets: Train and Test
train_data = pd.read_csv("/Users/gabrielguzman/School/Research/Data Science/titanic/train.csv")
test_data = pd.read_csv("/Users/gabrielguzman/School/Research/Data Science/titanic/train.csv")
```

```{python}
#---Exploratory Data Analysis---#

# Summary of train data
test_data.describe()
```

```{python}
# Women survived in train data 
women = train_data.loc[train_data.Sex == 'female']["Survived"]
rate_women = sum(women)/len(women)
print("% of women who survived:", rate_women)

# Men survived in train data 
men = train_data.loc[train_data.Sex == 'male']["Survived"]
rate_men = sum(men)/len(men)
print("% of men who survived:", rate_men)
```

```{python}
# Machine Learning Model (Randoom Forest Algorithm)

from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

y = train_data["Survived"]

features = ["Pclass", "Sex", "SibSp", "Parch"]
X = pd.get_dummies(train_data[features])
X_test = pd.get_dummies(test_data[features])

model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, max_depth=5, random_state=1)
model.fit(X, y)
predictions = model.predict(X_test)

output = pd.DataFrame({'PassengerId': test_data.PassengerId, 'Survived': predictions, 'Sex': test_data.Sex})
output.to_csv('submission.csv', index=False)
```

```{python}
# Female survived = 0.910828025 
# Male survived = 0.010398614

# % of women who survived: 0.7420382165605095
# % of men who survived: 0.18890814558058924
